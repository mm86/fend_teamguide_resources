Summary of Session 6:


Overview of Project 2:

Primary objective with P2 is to become familiar with the basics of JavaScript, jQuery and learn how to use APIs. 
We learn how to integrate HTML,CSS and JS (and jQuery) to create an interactive resume. Knowledge of JSON is important 
for front end development because sometimes you will not have access to database and can get data only in the form of JSON files.
Internet GET and POST requests frequently pass data in JSON format. So, learning how to use JSON can be very useful.


JavaScript in Project 2 is only limited to the basics such as - data types, for loops, conditionals and objects (such as functions).

We will not be covering Object Oriented Programming for Project 2 as it is only for project 3. So, don't worry about that.
You are always welcome to customize the css of your resume using bootstrap and your own layout. Some inspiration are

Project 2 contains 3 seperate files

index.html: Everything from here to the <script> tag below is the skeleton of your website. Your code will add information 
to each of the sections of the resume.
helper.js: The helper.js file is in place to help insert information into html using JS. You would work with helper.js to display your information by writing functions in the resumebuilder.js.
resumeBuilder.js: resumeBuilder.js takes the template strings in helper.js and inserts the HTML code inside our DOM.
